The Agreement consolidates the Company's existing term loans into a single loan facility that will be amortized over five years and is fully committed until January 1, 2023, with the option to renew for an additional 12 months subject to the Lender's approval. The Agreement provides for $1.0 million of additional growth capital immediately to expand Zedcor's Security and Surveillance business which is seeing growing customer demand, along with an uncommitted $2.0 million accordion facility that could be made available to the Company, subject to the Lender's credit approval. The Agreement is secured with a first charge over the Company's assets, bears interest at 12.75% per annum and has an extension fee of 2% per annum, $377,238 of which will be capitalized to the loan and $300,000 of which has been paid with the issuance of 2,000,000 common shares of Zedcor Inc. at a deemed priced of $0.15 per share. The Agreement will be serviced by equal, monthly blended principal and interest payments and does not require quantitative financial covenants. In addition, the Lender has been issued an additional 730,562 share purchase warrants with an exercise price of $0.12 per share and the exercise price of the 4,014,343 existing warrants already issued to the Lender will be amended to $0.12 per share. The expiry date of all outstanding warrants issued to the Lender will be November 25, 2024. All of the securities issued are subject to a four month hold period from the date of issue. At the end of the Agreement's initial term, Zedcor is projecting to have approximately $13.0 million of senior debt under its loan with the Lender, assuming the $2.0 million accordion facility has been fully drawn. This would represent a reduction of approximately 33% in the outstanding debt under the Agreement with the Lender. Based on current forecasts, estimated utilization of the Company's fleet of security towers, along with the additional assets purchased as part of the financing, Zedcor's senior debt to EBITDA ratio is projected to be below 2.5x which will put the Company in line with senior bank lending requirements and is consistent with the Company's strategic goal to deleverage its balance sheet.",

The new Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for an aggregate $250 million financing commitment by the lenders, consisting of an aggregate floorplan financing commitment of $185 million and an aggregate working capital commitment of $65 million. The floorplan facility may be used to advance up to 85% of the value of eligible new inventory and up to 75% of the value of eligible used inventory, which compares to the previous floorplan facility that allowed for an advance up to 70% of the value of both new and used eligible inventory. The working capital facility may be used to advance up to 85% of eligible accounts, 75% of the value of eligible rental equipment, 75% of the Company’s eligible parts inventory, and a percentage of other unencumbered assets such as vehicles and real estate.  The working capital advance rates are up to 5% higher than the previous facility and can include assets in the borrowing base that were not allowed under the old facility. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement does not obligate the Company to maintain financial covenants, except in the event that excess availability is less than 15% of the lower of the borrowing base or the size of the full credit line.  If excess availability levels are not met, then the Company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.10:1.00.  These terms are similar to those in the previous credit facility but favorably impacted by the increased advanced rates, which adds to the Company’s excess availability amount. The interest rate for loans under the credit facility will be equal to LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.5%) plus an applicable margin based on the Company’s excess availability.

On September 22, 2014, Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (“Pioneer”) entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2011, as amended by the First Amendment thereto dated as of March 3, 2014, (as so amended, and as further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) among Pioneer, the lenders party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”). The purpose of the Second Amendment was to, among other things, (a) increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the Credit Agreement from $250 million to $350 million, (b) extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement from June 30, 2016 to September 22, 2019, and (c) amend the pricing terms for borrowings and amend the commitment fee, in each case, as set forth below. Pioneer intends to use borrowings to redeem all of its existing 9.875% Senior Notes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Pioneer’s option, at the base rate or Eurodollar rate plus, in each case, an applicable per annum margin. The applicable per annum margin, which has been decreased in connection with the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, is determined based upon Pioneer’s total leverage ratio in accordance with a pricing grid. The per annum applicable margin for Eurodollar rate borrowings decreased from a range of 2.50% to 3.25% to the new range of 2.00% to 3.00%, and the per annum applicable margin for base rate borrowings was decreased from a range of 1.50% to 2.25% to the new range of 1.00% to 2.00%. Pioneer’s commitment fee due quarterly under the Credit Agreement is being lowered from 0.50% to a range of 0.40% to 0.50%",

The amendment reduces the facility's interest rates to LIBOR plus 1.50 percent to 2.00 percent and prime plus 0.50 percent to 1.00 percent, depending on utilization. The amendment also eliminates the springing maturity provision that would have accelerated the revolving credit facility's maturity to 90 days prior to May 1, 2016 if more than $250 million of the company's 8% senior notes remained outstanding as of that date. The springing maturity provision was replaced with a springing reserve provision that calls for a reserve to be placed against availability under the facility in the amount of any outstanding material indebtedness (as defined in the credit facility) that is due within 30 days of the date the reserve is established. In addition, the amendment also expands the ability to increase the company's $1.5 billion senior secured term loan facility, subject to a secured leverage test, by up to $500 million (previously $250 million), subject to identifying term loan lenders or other institutional lenders willing to provide the additional loans and the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. The amendment also contains modified covenants to give the company additional strategic and operational flexibility and includes certain other non-material changes. Additionally, the maturity date of the revolving credit facility was extended by eleven months to February 2019.",

Borrowings under the term loan facility and the revolving loan facility, at the Borrower’s option, bear interest at either the administrative agent’s base rate plus 2.5% or a LIBOR rate adjusted for certain additional costs (the “Eurodollar Rate”) plus 3.5%, each as defined in the new credit agreement. The Eurodollar Rate has a floor of 1.00% and the base rate has a floor of 2.00%, each with respect to the outstanding term loans. Commencing with the last business day of the Borrower’s fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2014, the Borrower is required to pay 0.25% of the principal amount of the terms loans each quarter, which may be reduced by voluntary prepayments. Mandatory prepayments under the new credit agreement are required with respect to certain asset sales, insurance recovery and incurrence of certain other debt and, commencing in 2015, in certain circumstances relating to cash flow for the prior fiscal year in excess of certain expenditures. In connection with entering into the new credit agreement, the Borrower amended and restated its existing interest rate swap arrangement, which will now have a notional amount of $160 million and will mature on May 15, 2018. The swap will effectively convert $160 million of variable-rate debt under the new credit agreement to a fixed rate of 5.38%, when including the applicable 3.50% margin described above.",
